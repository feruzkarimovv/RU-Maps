A graph-based navigation system for Rutgers University campus that models streets as edges and intersections as vertices. The project implements pathfinding algorithms including DFS for finding reachable locations, BFS for minimizing the number of intersections in a route, and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the fastest path considering traffic conditions. It calculates real-world metrics like block lengths using coordinate distances, simulates traffic with randomized factors, and provides comprehensive path analysis including total distance, average traffic, and estimated travel time.
